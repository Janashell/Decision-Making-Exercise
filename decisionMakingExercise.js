// I'm sorry Matt, but I have sat here and messed with these first few problems for almost two hours and can not figure them out. I usually try to study and go over things during the weekend, but really didnt have a chance to this weekend due to working on my portfolio. I will definatly do that this week and do my best to understand all this better.  I just didn't want you thinking that I didn't try.
